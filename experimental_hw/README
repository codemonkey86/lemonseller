Plan for experimental hw:  experimentation of Karp  vs. Howard algos for minimum mean cycle problem.  referece: http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/doc/latest/a00607.html

focus point:  Howard most efficient in practice, but exponential lower bound vs. polynomial of karp.

Implement both, space/time as laid out in blackboard,  randomize generation of graph to get large set over which to compare results. maybe identify the exponential end case where Howard hs poly bound.

At least discuss, if not code, comparision between using Lemon ListGraph vs. Static Graph, see:  http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/tutorial/a00014.html

Steps:
  establish cost functions, display output from implementations of both algos
  time space analysis
  randomize graph generation
  autonmate analysis to get results
  explore tolerancce objects
  compare with list graph if leftover time
